# Machine Learning and Data Analytics

In this introductory course towards machine learning, we were given foundational knowledge of data mining and were taught Decision trees, K-means Clustering and Neural Networks.

This sub-repository contains the code, and output of our project work during this course on neural networks.

# Regression using Neural Networks
Performed regression on a small dataset for the course project for theoretical understanding of NN.

## Dataset
Professor provided us with a dataset csv file loaded in the repository.

## Method
R-Studio was used to perfrorm the regression, . Overall and individual MSA, along with Eigen values were used to decide the number of factors. Rotated Factor matrix was used to determine the loading of variables on to factors. Read this code in conjunction with the attached pdf report to make more sense.

## Result
We developed 5 factors that had the explanatory power of 11 raw variables.
