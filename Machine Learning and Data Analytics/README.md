# Machine Learning and Data Analytics

In this introductory course towards machine learning, we were given foundational knowledge of data mining and were taught Decision trees, K-means Clustering and Neural Networks.

This sub-repository contains the code, and output of our project work during this course on neural networks.

# Regression using Neural Networks
Performed regression on a small dataset for the course project for theoretical understanding of NN.

## Dataset
Professor provided us with a dataset csv file loaded in the repository.

## Method
R-Studio, specifically "neuralnet" library was used to perfrorm the regression. Initial weights were given by professor. Code has been provided in the pdf file.

## Result
We tuned the initial weights to decrease the error rate from 0.349 to 0.347.
