# Regression in Tableau

1. Create a worksheet 1 to include products ordered equal to or more than 10 times through all time span, the apply the case swap function using tabpy to product names. Output a list with 3 columns: product_names, swapped_product_names, and product_order_count.

2. Create  a worksheet 2 to include the 3 time series lineplots along order date, y-axis are: cumulative sum of sales, cumulative sum of 5 * sales  computed by calculated field in Tableau, running sum of 2 * sales (with 1 former data point, 1 latter data point, and the current data point ) using tabpy. Lines is shown in different colors.  

3. Create  a worksheet 3, filter products with more than 10k sales total amount and build a sorted barchart for them, apply bool fields created by tabpy as color legend to make products with >= 20k sale total amount as blue while that of< 20k as orange.

4. In worksheet 4, Create a 2 scatterplot for Sales(x-axis) and Profit(y-axis), Color the dots with positive y values as blue, the negative ones as red, and add regression line in 2 ways. 1) Use Tableau automatically generated setting (Shown on top). 2) Manually compute intercepte and slope, code them in the calculated fields (Shown at bottom).
