# Course Project on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
DEA is one of the more advanced applications of linear programming in which the objective, as thought by 
our book, is to maximize the efficiency. Through our secondary research, we figured out to project 
DEA as a minimization problem to minimize the efficiency index of the business operating unit in 
question while comparing it to a composite unit. Composite unit is projected as an ideal, imaginary 
unit that takes the least amount of input and gives maximum amount of output based on the weights 
assigned from each of the business operating units
