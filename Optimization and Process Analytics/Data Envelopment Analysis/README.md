# Course Project on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
DEA is one of the more advanced applications of linear programming in which the objective, as thought by 
our book, is to maximize the efficiency. Through our secondary research, we figured out to project 
DEA as a minimization problem to minimize the efficiency index of the business operating unit in 
question while comparing it to a composite unit. Composite unit is projected as an ideal, imaginary 
unit that takes the least amount of input and gives maximum amount of output based on the weights 
assigned from each of the business operating units. While professor has taught us to maximize the efficiency respective to other business units.

## Dataset
The data for our model has been collected from Ranch House Inc, which is a fast-food restaurant 
chain with several branches across the country. We will be examining five of their branches located 
at Clarksville, Bardstown, Jeffersonville, St. Matthews and New Albany. As our goal is to Evaluate 
the performance of each branch and present our findings to the higher management at ranch house 
Inc, it is important that we decide on the right parameters i.e., input and output measures That best 
reflect the performance of each branch and allow for A comparative study.

## Method
Use the solver with the given inputs, outputs and constraints to minimize the efficiency index as compared to the composite unit.

## Result
It is possible for us to draw the conclusion that the restaurant in Clarksville and the 
restaurant in St. Matthews are not as efficient as the composite unit.
