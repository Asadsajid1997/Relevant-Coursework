# GRG Non-Linear Optimization
We designed a research proposal for a clothing firm to determine the price at which they should sell their remaining inventory in order to finish the product by a particular time, with the objective of maximizing the profit margin. 
We used the price-demand elasticity concept and made reasonable assumptions about the dataset where we felt neccessary, as we were allowed to do so. We used non linear programming in this proposal because the price-demand function is not linear.

# Results
Using Solver, we determined that the firm must sell the particular product at $12.27 to replinish the remaining inventory by a particular time while maintaining 35% profit margin.
