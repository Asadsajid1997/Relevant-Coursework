# Exploratory Factor Analysis
Performed exploratory factor analysis on a house pricing dataset for the course project.

## Dataset
We used a housing dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

We converted categorical variables into numerical by encoding them. 

## Method
SAS was used perfrorm the analysis. Overall and individual MSA, along with Eigen values were used to decide the number of factors. Rotated Factor matrix was used to determine the loading of variables on to factors. Read this code in conjunction with the attached pdf report to make more sense.

## Result
We developed 5 factors that had the explanatory power of 11 raw variables.
