# Stepwise Regression Analysis
Performed Stepwise regression analysis on a house pricing dataset for the course project.

## Dataset
We used a housing dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.

We converted categorical variables into numerical by encoding them. We started with 27 variables in the raw dataset.

## Method
SAS was used perfrorm the analysis. P-value was the criteria used to determine the inclusion or exclusion of a variable from the model. 
Read this code in conjunction with the attached pdf report to make more sense.

## Result
After the stepwise regression, we had retained 18 out of 27 variables as important to predict sale price of the house. The overall R-squared with 19 variables was 0.81 which means 81% of the variation in house prices could be explained by the model.
