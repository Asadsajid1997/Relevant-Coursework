## Final Project: Churn Analysis

The objective of this project is to help PowerCo., a gas and electricity distribution company, anticipate customer churn that would ultimately help them save those customers. After analyzing the data and applying around 7 machine learning algorithms, we achieved an accuracy of 90% and a recall of 76% on the test data. This indicates our modelsâ€™ ability to predict customer churn and offers an opportunity to explore a discounted rate of 20% as a potential solution.
