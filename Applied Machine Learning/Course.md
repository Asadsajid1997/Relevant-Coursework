## Applied Machine Learning:

In this course, we used Python to study about several machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forest,
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and KNNs. This folder includes the assignments and the project done as part
of this course.

# Final Project: Churn Analysis
The objective of this project is to help PowerCo., a gas and electricity distribution company,
anticipate customer churn that would ultimately help them save those customers. After
analyzing the data and applying around 7 machine learning algorithms, we achieved an accuracy
of 90% and a recall of 76% on the test data. This indicates our modelsâ€™ ability to predict customer
churn and offers an opportunity to explore a discounted rate of 20% as a potential solution.
