## Introduction
This report covers the effects of 2 treatments/factors namely smoking type and work type on the dependent variable glucose level. The covariate variable age and the blocking variable BMI is also taken into account to find the effect of the two factors on the glucose level using five experimental design techniques that include CRD, CRAC, RBD, RBF and CRF.. For smoking type, we used 3 types; formerly smokers, never smokers, smokers. For work type, we used 4 types; children, private job, government job, self employed.
